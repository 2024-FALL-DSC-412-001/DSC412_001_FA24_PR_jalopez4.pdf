Welcome to ColorSense M.L learning algorithm! This is a machine learning algorithm using specialized models to train a computer to detect colors in hopes to be applied to future biomedical devices! Specifically smart glasses that have an implemented biosensor whether in the glasses, retina of the eye, or the brain. 

To use this model, begin by selecting a number of images you want the model to detect, it has be trained and tested to be able to detect red, green, and blue colors. Feel free to use single images that include all three colors or just 2, the choice is yours!

The images must either be PNG, JPEG, or JPG

Once done hit "Run all" and at the bottom you will see plots with the Red, Green, and Blue channels detecting the accuracy of the color prediction.

Enjoy!
